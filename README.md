# Spelunker

Spelunker is a tool that will parse through your codebase and generate automated mocks 

## Features
- Autogenerates a 'test' folder if one does not exist

- Skips over functions that have 'spelunker_skip' above the definition

- Generates individual test files with corresponding test methods

- Generates a code coverage report within the terminal upon completion

## Prerequisites

Ensure you are running a Python version >= 3.6

```zsh
$ python3 --version # returns 'Python 3.7.7' or a version >= 'Python 3.6'
```

## Usage

Run in terminal from the file (I will eventually publish this project up to pip for install/run directly)

```zsh
$ python3 [PATH TO SPELUNKER DIR]/src/Spelunker.py
```
